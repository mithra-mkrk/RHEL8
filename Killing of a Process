we have 64 types to kill a process

We mainly use -9 = sigkill
              -15 = sigterm 
              
syntax: kill -15 pid

kill -15 : in this when the kernal sends you the order to kill a process , the process would consult the child process and then terminate those Cchild process).
In this case the child process may disobey/ignore the kill command.
After the process is completed by the child user which has not been killed , would try to realse and reach out the parent process , but the parent process has been 
already killed.
so that paticluar child process would become a ZOMBIE process.


Kill -9: SIGKILL: there would not seking any permission , it would forcefully kill the process.

ps -- gives all the process which are running.
jobs-- provides the list of all the jobs
Kill -l : provides the list of all the kills present in the rehel
bg-- background
fg-- foreground
pkill -uid
man pkill -- provides manual of pkill
